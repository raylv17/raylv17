- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @raylv17
- I create **stuff** in LaTeX/TikZ and Python.

- Iâ€™m interested in creating useful simulations (to simulate chaos, emergence, and hopefully adaptabililty in natural systems)
- Iâ€™m currently learning python and numerical methods (PDE).  
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with people with similar interests, someone I can work and learn with.
